<p>This article is quite interesting to me because the author provides tips for rookies in software engineering basing on his career experience. He provided questions to help software developers intervew the interviewers to help get more information about the job position they applied. Meanwhile, he gave out his practical thoughts and recommandation on coding and debugging in details. What's more, he privde useful sources which can help developers improve their skills.

The most appealing part of this artile is interview part. The author is using the question and answer structure to tell us about the key points which might make you stand out during the interview. Besides, the humor he was using in those red flags makes the article much easier to undertsand while precisely conveying the idea behind each interview question. Another thing I like about this article is the suggestion about being a better software engineer. He approached it from many different perspectives and I learnt a lot through reading it.
